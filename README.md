**1.Site Navigation (30): Home, Favorite Links, Resume, “Other”, Feedback**
• 5 working links throughout the site’s pages; remove each page’s own link to itself (but leave the text)

**2. Content & Coding for Old Pages (30): Resume, Fave Links, Feedback, & Response**
• Styled like rest of site, Resume page has no info from original video (all your own info), Fave links are all your own, feeback pages have updated select list, fieldset bg color, & feedback & response images

**3. New Page Content for the Home Page & the “Other” Page
**Pages' text content must take up at least most of the available 1920x1080 space in browser window.
a) Home page: (25)
• Create a paragraph introducing you and your site (several sentences).
• This page should also include an ordered list of interests or hobbies or activities you like
• An unordered list of short personal trivia items (such as "I'm obsessed with American Idol"),
• Small picture of yourself or of a role model of yours or someone you admire…
• Along with a paragraph about that picture and why you chose it.
• You can also insert a 2nd image, but these images must be small and not dominate the page
b) “Other” page: (25)
• Page should contain truthful, original personal info about a topic – not general info about it.
• Must have an image, but page must be mostly text (fill up the page). Explain images with text.

**4. Create Your own LOGO (25)**
• There are some links to logo creation sites in Canvas’ Recommended Final Project Resources area.
• The logo must include the text "Firstname Lastname's World" where you substitute your own actual first and last name, and you may choose to substitute another word (or 2 or 3) for "world".
• The logo can have other artwork, photo(s), background, texture, etc.
• The logo should be placed at the top of all pages in the site’s “header” area, using an <img> tag.
• Your logo image and all other images, should contain descriptive "alt text" in the HTML img tags.

**5. CSS Styles for Your Site (30)**
• Create a separate “.css” file and then create a “link” to that file in the "head" section of all pages
• Create a consistent site wide color scheme (backgrounds & text colors) that goes with your logo.
• Create appropriate nav bar link styles – there should be some changes when the mouse moves over them in browser. Use such selectors as a:hover and a:visited to do this. Links should be easy to read.
• Create font-family and color settings (using proper lists of fonts) for "body" text and heading text
• All formatting should be done with CSS styles inside this separate .css style sheet file
• Validate your CSS styles using a CSS code validator like the one at W3C.

**6. Testing Your Final Project Site (35)**
• Site looks good, works well, fills up a Chrome window at 1920x1080 using normal image / font sizes
• All HTML5 and CSS code validates on all pages with no missing closing tags (errors = deductions)
• Spell-check the text on your pages, no generic text left over on pages – add your own footer text

**7. Extra credit (max of 15, 5 pts each)**
1. Nav bar uses image buttons instead of text for links (images must look good!)
2. Resume page's info is broken up into 2 columns (headings on left) – using table or CSS
3. Home page's main content organized in 2 columns (see sample screen shot) – using table or CSS
